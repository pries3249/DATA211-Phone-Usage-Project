# DATA211 Course Project — Phone Usage Analysis

**Author:** Paul  
**Course:** DATA 211  
**Semester:** Fall 2025  

## 📌 Project Summary
This project analyzes my daily phone usage over a 16-day period to determine whether I use my phone more on weekdays or weekends. 
The analysis includes data collection, summary statistics, visualization, and a statistical hypothesis test.

**Research question:**  
> Do I use my phone more on weekdays than on weekends?

I collected my total phone screen-time (in minutes) each day and labeled each day as a weekday or weekend.

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Weekday mean usage:** about 553 minutes (≈ 9.2 hours)  
- **Weekend mean usage:** about 300 minutes (≈ 5.0 hours)  
- **Overall mean usage:** about 458 minutes (≈ 7.6 hours)  
- **Two-sample Welch t-test (Weekday − Weekend):**  
  - t ≈ 3.8, df ≈ 12.6  
  - One-sided p-value < 0.01  

**Conclusion:**  
I reject the null hypothesis and conclude that I use my phone **significantly more on weekdays than on weekends**.

## 📈 Included Visualizations (generated by `analysis_code.py`)
- **Boxplot:** weekday vs weekend usage  
- **Scatterplot:** daily usage over all 16 days  
- **Histogram:** distribution of weekday vs weekend usage  

These plots are saved as:
- `boxplot_weekday_weekend.png`
- `scatter_daily_usage.png`
- `hist_weekday_weekend.png`

## 🧮 Statistical Methods
I used an independent two-sample **Welch t-test** to compare weekdays and weekends.  
- **Null hypothesis (H₀):** mean weekday usage = mean weekend usage  
- **Alternative hypothesis (Hₐ):** mean weekday usage > mean weekend usage  

The large positive t-statistic (around 3.8) and p-value below 0.01 indicate strong evidence that my weekday usage is higher.

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Install `matplotlib` if needed:

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

3. From the root of this repository, run:

   ```bash
   python code/analysis_code.py
   ```

This will:
- Print summary statistics and t-test results to the terminal.
- Save the three plots (boxplot, scatterplot, histogram) as PNG files in the repo folder.

## 📝 Reflection (short version)
Through this project I learned how to collect real-world data, store it in a structured format, and analyze it using Python. 
I practiced creating visualizations that clearly show patterns, and I learned how to apply a t-test to answer a question about my own behavior. 
This helped me see how statistics connects to my everyday life, especially my phone habits.
